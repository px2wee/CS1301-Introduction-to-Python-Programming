#Write a function called modify_list. modify_list will
#take one parameter, a list. It should then modify the
#list in the following ways, in this order:
#
# - Sort the list (using the default sort method). .sort()
# - Reverse the order of the list. .reverse()
# - Delete the last three items of the list. del myList[-3:]
# - Removes one instance the integer 7 from the list, if
#   it's present. remove(7)
# - Double the values of the first and third items in
#   the list. 
#
#It should then return the resulting list. You may assume
#the list will start with at least six items.
#
#Hint: Remember Python is 0-indexed. The second item
#does not have an index of 2.
#
#Hint 2: Remember, the list.remove() function removes items
#by value, not by index. Note also that if the item you're
#trying to remove is not found in the list, remove() will
#throw an error: so, you'll want to avoid that one way or
#another!


#Write your code here!
def modify_list(mylist):
    mylist.sort()
    mylist.reverse()
    del mylist[-3:]
    try:
        mylist.remove(7)
    except:
        pass
    #print(mylist)
    mylist[0] = mylist[0]*2
    mylist[2] = mylist[2]*2
    return mylist


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
