#Write a function called classify_numbers. classify_numbers should
#take as input a list. You may assume every item in the list will
#be an integer.
#
#classify_numbers should return a dictionary with the following
#five keys: evens, odds, positives, negatives, zeros
#
#The values associated with those keys should be the number of
#times each type of number appears in the list.
#
#For example:
#
#classify_numbers([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]) ->
#{"evens": 3, "odds": 2, "positives": 2, "negatives": 2, "zeros": 1}
#
#Note that every number in the list will be counted twice: once
#as either even or odd, and once as either positive, negative,
#or zero. 0 should be considered an even number. If a type of
#number never appears, the key should still appear with a value of
#0.


#Write your function here!
def classify_numbers(mylist):
    evens = 0
    odds = 0
    positives = 0
    negatives = 0
    zeros = 0
    for num in mylist:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            evens += 1
        if num % 2 == 1:
            odds += 1
        if num > 0:
            positives += 1
        if num < 0:
            negatives += 1
        if num == 0:
            zeros += 1

#{"evens": 3, "odds": 4, "positives": 6, "negatives": 0, "zeros": 1}
