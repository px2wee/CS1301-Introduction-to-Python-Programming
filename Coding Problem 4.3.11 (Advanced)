#You've been sent a list of names. Unfortunately, the names
#come in two different formats:
#
#First Middle Last
#Last, First Middle
#
#You want the entire list to be the same. For this problem,
#we'll say you want the entire list to be First Middle Last.
#
#Write a function called name_fixer. name_fixer should take
#as input the list of strings. You may assume that every string
#will match one of the two formats above: either First Middle Last
#or Last, First Middle. 
#
#name_fixer should return a list of names all structured as
#First Middle Last. If the name was already structured as
#First Middle Last, it should remain unchanged. If it was
#structured as Last, First Middle, then Last should be moved
#to the end after a space and the comma removed.
#
#The names should appear in the same order as the original list.
#
#For example:
#
#name_list = ["David Andrew Joyner", "Hart, Melissa Joan", "Cyrus, Billy Ray"]
#name_fixer(name_list) -> ["David Andrew Joyner", "Melissa Joan Hart", "Billy Ray Cyrus"]


#Add your code here!
