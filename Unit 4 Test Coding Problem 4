#Write a function called highest_number. highest_number should
#have one parameter: a string representing a filename. Inside
#the file, there will be a list of numbers separated by commas
#on each line. In the dropdown box in the top left, you may
#select a_few_numbers.txt to see an example of such a file.
#
#highest_number should return the highest number found in the
#file. For example, for the contents of a_few_numbers.txt, the
#highest number is 99, the second-to-last value on the second
#line.


#Write your function here!
