#Write a function called recent_median. recent_median should
#take as input one parameter, a list of integers. recent_median
#should return the median of the last five numbers in the list.
#
#The median is the middle number when the numbers are sorted.
#For example:
#
# recent_median([6, 1, 2, 9, 8, 3, 4, 5, 7]) -> 5
#
#The last five numbers in the list are: 8, 3, 4, 5, 7. The median
#of these numbers (that is, the middle number when sorted) is 5.


#Write your function here!
def recent_median(mylist):
    newlist = mylist[-5:]
    newlist.sort()
    
    return newlist[2]

#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print: 5, 35, 29, each on its own line
print(recent_median([6, 1, 2, 9, 8, 3, 4, 5, 7]))
