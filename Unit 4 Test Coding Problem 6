#Write a function called collect_makes. collect_makes should
#take as input one parameter, a list. Every item in the list
#will be a string.
#
#The strings will all represent the names of cars, such as
#"Mazda Miata", "Ford F150", and "Nissan Leaf". Every car
#will be given by a two-word name, with the first word being
#the car "make" (the brand) and the second word being the
#car "model" (the specific type of car). You may assume that
#we will only include one-word makes and one-word models;
#we won't include a Tesla Model S, Jeep Town & Country, etc.
#
#Your function should return a dictionary. The keys of the
#dictionary should be all the car makes found in the list.
#The values should be alphabetically-sorted lists of models
#found corresponding to the given makes.
#
#For example:
#
#car_list = ["Mazda Miata", "Ford F150", "Nissan Leaf",
#            "Ford Fusion", "Nissan Rogue", "Nissan Murano"]
#collect_makes(car_list) -> {"Mazda": ["Miata"],
#                            "Ford": ["F150, Fusion"],
#                            "Nissan": ["Leaf", "Murano", "Rogue"]}
#
#Remember, the order of dictionary keys does not matter.
#However, you should make sure the lists of car models
#is sorted alphabetically! (Notice that Murano is listed
#before Rogue under Nissan above.)


#Write your function here!
def collect_makes(mylist):
    dictionary = {}
    for car in mylist:
        car = car.split(" ")
        if car[0] not in dictionary:
            dictionary[car[0]] = []
        dictionary[car[0]].append(car[1])
    return dictionary


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print (with keys possibly in a different order):
#{"Mazda": ["Miata"], "Ford": ["F150, Fusion"], "Nissan": ["Leaf", "Murano", "Rogue"]}
