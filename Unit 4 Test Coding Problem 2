#Write a function called write_nhl_teams. write_nhl_teams will
#take as input two parameters: a string and a list of 5-tuples.
#
#The string will represent the filename to which to write.
#
#Each 5-tuple in the list will contain five strings. The
#strings will represent, in order:
#
# - The location name of a team
# - The mascot of a team
# - The city in which the team plays
# - The state or province in which the team plays
# - The country in which the team plays
#
#write_nhl_teams should write the list of teams to the file given
#by the filename using the following format:
#
# [location] [mascot], [city], [state/province], [country]
#
#Note there is no comma between location and mascot, but
#there are commas between mascot and city, between city and state,
#and between state and country.
#
#So, for this list:
#
# [("New Jersey", "Devils", "Newark", "New Jersey", "USA"),
#  ("Winnipeg", "Jets", "Winnipeg", "Manitoba", "Canada")]
#
#The file printed would look like this:
#
#New Jersey Devils, Newark, New Jersey, USA
#Winnipeg Jets, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada
#
#We've included Sample.txt to show you what one of these
#files should look like.


#Write your function here!
def write_nhl_teams(filename, mylist):
    file_output = open(filename, "w")
    for tuple_info in mylist:
        file_output.write(tuple_info[0] + " " + tuple_info[1] + ", " + tuple_info[2] + ", " + tuple_info[3] + ", " + tuple_info[4] + "\n")
    
    file_output.close()


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print nothing -- however, it should write the same contents
#as Sample.txt to Test.txt.
