#The line below will open a file containing information
#about every pokemon through Generation 7:

pokedex = open('../resource/lib/public/pokedex.csv', 'r')

#We've also provided a sample subset of the data in
#sample.csv.
#
#Each line of the file has 13 values, separated by commas.
#They are: 
#
#
# - Number: The numbered ID of the Pokemon, an integer
# - Name: The name of the Pokemon, a string
# - Type1: The Pokemon's primary type, a string
# - Type2: The Pokemon's secondary type, a string (this
#   may be blank)
# - HP: The Pokemon's HP statistic, an integer in the range
#   1 to 255
# - Attack: The Pokemon's Attack statistic, an integer in
#   the range 1 to 255
# - Defense: The Pokemon's Defense statistic, an integer in
#   the range 1 to 255
# - SpecialAtk: The Pokemon's Special Attack statistic, an
#   integer in the range 1 to 255
# - SpecialDef: The Pokemon's Special Defense statistic, an
#   integer in the range 1 to 255
# - Speed: The Pokemon's Speed statistic, an integer in the
#   range 1 to 255
# - Generation: What generation the Pokemon debuted in, an
#   integer in the range 1 to 7
# - Legendary: Whether the Pokemon is considered "legendary"
#   or not, either TRUE or FALSE
# - Mega: Whether the Pokemon is "Mega" or not, either TRUE
#   or FALSE
#
#Use this dataset to answer the questions below.
#1,Bulbasaur,Grass,Poison,45,49,49,65,65,45,1,FALSE,FALSE
#2,Ivysaur,Grass,Poison,60,62,63,80,80,60,1,FALSE,FALSE

#Here, add any code you want to allow you to answer the
#questions asked below over on edX. This is just a sandbox
