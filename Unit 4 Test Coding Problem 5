#Write a function called expand_to_list. expand_to_list should
#have two parameters, both integers. For thise description, we
#will refer to these integers as mid and n.
#
#expand_to_list should return a list, such that the middle
#number of the list is mid, and there are n numbers on either
#side in incremental ascending order.
#
#Here are a few examples:
#
# expand_to_list(5, 2) -> [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
#
#5 is the middle number, and there are 2 numbers before it and
#2 numbers after it.
#
# expand_to_list(10, 4) -> [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
#
#10 is the middle number, and there are 4 numbers before it
#and 4 numbers after it.
#
# expand_to_list(0, 1) -> [-1, 0, 1]
#
#0 is the middle number, and there is 1 number before it and
#1 number after it.


#Write your function here!
def expand_to_list(num_mid, num_n):
    result = []
    result.append(num_mid)

    for i in range(num_n):
        add = num_mid + i + 1
        minus = num_mid - i - 1
        result.append(add)
        result.append(minus)
    
    result.sort()
    return result


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print:

#[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
#[-1, 0, 1]
