#In the racing video game Mario Kart, up to 12 players
#can race against each other. At the end of each race,
#players receive points based on where they finished in
#the race. At the end of some number of races, the player
#with the most points wins.
#
#In this problem, let's assume only 4 players are playing,
#and that they are going to complete 4 races. In each race,
#whoever finishes first gets 5 points; second place gets
#3 points; third place gets 2 points; and fourth place gets
#1 point.
#
#Write a function called find_winner. find_winner will
#take as input a list of four 4-tuples. Each 4-tuple
#represents the finishing order for a particular race.
#Player 1's finishing place is in index 0; Player 2 in
#index 1; Player 3 in index 2; and Player 4 in index 3.
#
#For example: (3, 4, 2, 1) would indicate that Player 1
#came in 3rd, Player 2 came in 4th, Player 3 came in 2nd,
#and Player 4 came in 1st.
#
#find_winner should return the winner of the four-race
#series with the string "Player X wins!", where X is
#replaced by the winning player's number. If two or more
#players tie for first, find_winner should just return
#the string "It's a tie!"
#
#For example:
#
# race_list = [(4, 3, 2, 1), (3, 2, 4, 1),
#              (4, 1, 3, 2), (2, 4, 3, 1)]
# find_winner(race_list) -> "Player 4 wins!"
#
#In the example above, Player 4 would have 18 points:
#5 points for each first-place finish, 3 points for
#the second-place finish. Player 3 would have 8 points;
#Player 2 would have 11 points; and Player 1 would have
#7 points. Therefore, Player 4 would win.


#Write your function here!
